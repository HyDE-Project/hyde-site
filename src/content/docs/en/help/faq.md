#### Global wallpapers

Global wallpapers will be shown in the selector across all themes.

In your `xdg_config/hyde/config.toml` add this.

[wallpaper]
custom_paths = [
    "$XDG_PICTURES_DIR",
    "/path/to/pretty/wallpapers",
] # List of paths to search for wallpapers

```

#### Custom wallpapers per theme

##### Option 1: GUI

Using dolphin to select a wallpaper/s for a theme

- Change Wallpaper

- Change SDDM settings
  (colors, background, date format, font) can be configured in `/usr/share/sddm/themes/corners/theme.conf`

if you want to modify the structure then you'll have to modify the qml files in /usr/share/sddm/themes/corners/components

<summary id="keyboard-layout">How can I change keyboard layout?</summary>

In HyDE we have the `~/.config/hypr/userprefs.conf` add the configuration in there.

```
input {
  kb_layout = us,de
}
```

Use `SUPER` + `K` to switch between layouts.

<summary id="app-launcher">How can I launch it on app launcher?</summary>
<div>

Find the .desktop entry using this handy command find /usr/share/applications -name '\*code.desktop' image
You should copy then edit the .desktop entry of each application to `~/.local/share/applications/`
Find the Exec = part then add the flags
image

:::note
ðŸ“¢ Remember, if you're looking to edit or create a .desktop file, it's a good practice to place it in ~/.local/share/applications/ to avoid modifying >system-wide files. This ensures that your changes are user-specific and do not require administrative privileges

Here is the [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_entries) on how to deal with .desktop entries.

Note that if the application does not support Wayland, HyDE, Hyprland and Wayland itself don't have powers to magically fixed the issue! Do not report this as an issue, try to open questions on the [Discussion panel](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/Hyde-cli) for help.

Known Issues

- Few scaling issues with rofi configs, as they are created based on my ultrawide (21:9) display.
- Random lockscreen crash, refer https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/7046
- Waybar launching rofi breaks mouse input (added sleep 0.1 as workaround), refer https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/1850
- Flatpak QT apps do not follow system theme

<summary id="sddm-login-loop">Login failed!" loop on SDDM?</summary>
<div>

If your user (or login name) contains capitalisation or special characters, you will need to edit your SDDM theme to be able to log in through the SDDM.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. When in the SDDM screen, open a tty with `Ctrl + Alt + F6` (or other F key)
2. Log in as the account with the issue
3. `nano usr/share/sddm/themes/[theme name]/theme.conf`
4. Find parameter `AllowBadUsername` and set it to true
5. Reboot

If you still can't log in after these steps, you can set, on the same file, `AllowEmptyPassword` to true, reboot, log in still writing your password, and after logging in you can set it back to false safely.

Here is a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE/issues/404) about this behaviour.
