## Name

`hyde-shell` - HyDE script execution wrapper and environment resolver

## Synopsis

```
hyde-shell [command] [arguments...]
hyde-shell [--help | help | -h]
hyde-shell [-r | reload]
```

## Description

`hyde-shell` is a universal wrapper script that executes HyDE scripts without file extensions and solves PATH-related issues where users might accidentally overwrite `~/.local/lib/hyde` in their PATH.

Located in `~/.local/bin/`, `hyde-shell` automatically discovers and executes scripts from the HyDE library directory, handling both Python scripts (.py) and shell scripts (.sh) without requiring file extensions.

## Options

**`--help, help, -h`**
: Display help message showing available commands and usage information.

**`-r, reload`**
: Reload the HyDE environment and refresh all configurations.

## Built-in Commands

**`wallbash`**
: Execute a wallbash script for dynamic theming and color management.

## Script Execution

`hyde-shell` provides access to all HyDE scripts without requiring file extensions:

```bash
hyde-shell waybar              # Executes waybar.py
hyde-shell theme.import        # Executes theme.import.py
hyde-shell wallpaper           # Executes wallpaper.sh
hyde-shell screenrecord          # Executes screenrecord.sh
```

The wrapper automatically discovers and resolves all scripts in the HyDE library directory.

## Usage Examples

Execute any HyDE script without file extension:
```bash
hyde-shell waybar --help           # Run waybar.py with help flag
hyde-shell theme.import            # Run theme.import.py
hyde-shell wallpaper               # Run wallpaper.sh
```

Use built-in commands:
```bash
hyde-shell wallbash                # Execute wallbash scripts in ~/.config/hyde/wallbash/scripts/

hyde-shell reload                  # Reload HyDE environment
```

Pass arguments to underlying scripts:
```bash
hyde-shell waybar --set layout-1   # Pass arguments to waybar.py
```

## Key Features

- **Script Path Resolution**: Finds scripts in `~/.local/lib/hyde/` regardless of PATH configuration
- **Extension Handling**: Automatically appends appropriate file extensions (.py, .sh)
- **PATH Independence**: Works regardless of current PATH configuration or working directory

## Files

**`~/.local/bin/hyde-shell`**
: Main executable wrapper script

**`~/.local/lib/hyde/`**
: Directory containing all HyDE scripts and modules

## Notes

- Always prefer `hyde-shell` over direct script execution for maximum compatibility
- File extensions are optional and automatically resolved
- Future HyDE versions will increasingly rely on `hyde-shell` for script execution
