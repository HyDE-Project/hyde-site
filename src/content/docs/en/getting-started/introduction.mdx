The HyDE project is still in progress...
The documentation is not yet fully complete, but we are actively working to improve and expand it.
::::

HyDE is a clean, aesthetic, and modular development environment for Hyprland on
Arch. It focuses on a consistent look and feel, sensible defaults, and upgrades
that don't get in your way.

## What you'll find here

- A guided installation flow and tips for first boot
- An opinionated, modular layout that keeps configuration tidy
- Theming tools and a community gallery for sharing styles
- Reference docs for bundled utilities and commands
